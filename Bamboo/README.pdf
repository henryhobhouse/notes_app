Hi there, welcome to the world of Bamboo. Here we will be explaining how to use
our award-winning software to test-drive your node applications. Please be aware
that by agreeing to use our software, you are entering into a non-binding
agreement that prevents the licensing or distribution without our consent.
Also we absolve ourselves of liability in the event of serious injury or death
caused as a result of using Bamboo. Finally, please do not use Bamboo in the
vicinity of Pandas. Thank you, and have a nice day.


Tutorial:

Here is an example of a test utilising the .equal method:

exports["The panda eats bamboo"] = function() {
  expect.equal("Panda", "Panda", 'Does the Panda eat bamboo?');
};

Where it is written: "The panda eats bamboo", is where you should place your
'it' statement. After the expect.equal, the first two "Panda" strings represent
the values that you are comparing. The final message is your summary of the
test.
